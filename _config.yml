title: ðŸ§  Muhammad Nouman Ahsan â€” Intelligent Systems Engineer
description: |
  Welcome to my portfolio! Iâ€™m a passionate developer and AI engineer with a deep interest in building intelligent, automation-driven systems. My focus lies at the intersection of **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and **agentic workflows**, creating tools that make complex technologies more intuitive and usable.

  I specialize in crafting large language model (LLM)-powered solutions, designing modular AI systems, and architecting pipelines that convert abstract ideas into real, interactive applications. From multimodal understanding to AI-assisted code reasoning, my work aims to simplify human-AI interaction and accelerate problem-solving through thoughtful engineering.
