Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate developer and AI engineer with a deep interest in building intelligent, automation-driven systems. My focus lies at the intersection of **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and **agentic workflows**, creating tools that make complex technologies more intuitive and usable.

I specialize in crafting large language model (LLM)-powered solutions, designing modular AI systems, and architecting pipelines that convert abstract ideas into real, interactive applications. From multimodal understanding to AI-assisted code reasoning, my work aims to simplify human-AI interaction and accelerate problem-solving through thoughtful engineering.


## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔍 [CodeMind – AI Code Intelligence Platform](./projects/codemind.md)  
A full-stack system combining a FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend to help developers analyze, explore, and understand codebases using LLMs. Features agentic workflows powered by ReactAgent, semantic vector search, and multi-model backend support including OpenAI, vLLM, llama.cpp, Transformers, and more.

### 🧾 [OCR Data Toolkit – Synthetic OCR Dataset Generator](./projects/ocr_data_toolkit.md)  
A powerful Python toolkit for generating realistic text images with configurable fonts, backgrounds, and augmentations. Supports multiprocessing, ground truth generation, and a rich set of augmentations to help train robust OCR models in the absence of large annotated datasets.

### 🔐 [Enigma – WWII Machine Simulator](./projects/enigma.md)  
A Python package and CLI tool that simulates the historic Enigma machine used during WWII. Includes full control over rotors, ring settings, plugboards, and reflectors — with detailed encoding traces for educational or cryptographic use.
