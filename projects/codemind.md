## 🧠 What is CodeMind?

**CodeMind** is a smart code exploration and analysis system that brings **LLM-assisted understanding**, **semantic search**, and **interactive Q&A** to your programming projects. It consists of:

- ⚙️ A **FastAPI backend** with agentic workflow architecture powered by **ReactAgent**, capable of intelligent multi-step reasoning and tool chaining.
- 💻 A **Streamlit frontend** that provides a beautiful, user-friendly dashboard to query and visualize your code with the help of AI.

Together, they create a **developer assistant** that feels like pair programming with a genius collaborator.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Agentic Workflows with ReactAgent

- **Dynamic Tool Selection**  
  CodeMind leverages **ReactAgent** to intelligently break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. It dynamically selects and sequences the most relevant tools to complete multi-part instructions effectively.

- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**  
  The agent performs structured, chain-of-thought reasoning—executing tools one by one, analyzing intermediate results, and adjusting its approach as needed until the desired output is produced.

- **Custom Tool Registration**  
  The system supports easy registration of custom tools, such as documentation extractors, diagram generators, or test writers. This modularity allows teams to tailor CodeMind to their specific workflows.

- **Extensible and Domain-Agnostic**  
  While built for code understanding, the agent is fully extensible and adaptable to entirely different domains. Its capabilities depend solely on the registered tools, making it a versatile orchestration layer for any LLM-powered workflow.
